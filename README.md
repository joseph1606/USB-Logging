This project proposes the development of a USB logging application tailored for air-gapped systems, enhancing security by actively monitoring physical USB ports. Designed as a school project completed with three other students for a computer security class, the application aims to work with intrusion protection systems to provide an additional layer of defense against unauthorized access. Utilizing a predefined whitelist to filter recognized devices, the system ensures efficient and relevant notifications. It addresses the vulnerabilities of air-gapped systems through USB logging, anomaly detection, and periodic controlled network connectivity for updating intrusion detection system signatures. The evaluation plan includes metrics such as detection rate, response time, and data exfiltration detection to assess the effectiveness of the USB logging product.
